\includegraphics[scale=1]{Nov_3_1.png}\\
    Three components are connected to form a system as shown in the diagram. Because the components in the 2-3 subsystem are connected in parallel, that subsystem will function if at least one of the two individual components functions. For the entire system to function, component 1 must function and so must the 2-3 subsystem.\\ \\
    The experiment consists of determining the condition of each component [S (success) if functional and F (failure) if not].
\\ \\
(a) Which outcomes are contained in the event A that exactly two out of the three components function?
\\
(b) Which outcomes are contained in the event B that at least two of the components function?
\\
(c) Which outcomes are contained in the event C that the system functions?
\\
(d) List outcomes in $C^\prime$, and A $\cup$ C, A $\cap$ C, B $\cup$ C, and B $\cap$ C.

A family consisting of three persons, -- A, B, and C -- goes to a medical clinic that always has a doctor at each of the stations 1, 2, and 3. During a certain week, each member of the family visits the clinic once and is assigned at random to a station. The experiment consists of recording the station number for each member. One outcome is (1, 2, 1) for A to station 1, B to station 2, and C to station 1.

\begin{problem}[2.2.19]
Human visual inspection of solder joints on printed circuit boards can be very subjective. In one batch of 10,000 joints, inspector A found 724 that were judged defective, inspector B found 751 such joints, and 1159 of the joints were judged defective by at least one of the inspectors. Suppose that one of the 10,000 joints is randomly selected.
\\ \\
(a) What is the probability that the selected joint was judged to be defective by neither of the two inspectors?
\\
(b) What is the probability that the selected joint was judged to be defective by inspector B but not by inspector A?


\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item From the problem, we get
		\begin{align*}
			P(A) &= \frac{724}{10000} \\
			P(B) &= \frac{751}{10000} \\
			P(A \cup B) &= \frac{1159}{10000}
		\end{align*}
		We are looking for $P(\neg A \cap \neg B)$. This is equivalent (by the probability version of De Morgan's Law) to $P(\neg(A \cup B))$, which is $1 - P(A \cup B)$. This comes out to $\boxed{\tfrac{8841}{10000}}$.

\begin{problem}[2.4.52]
A system consists of two identical pumps, $\#$1 and $\#$2. If one pump fails, the system will still operate. However, because of the added strain, the remaining pump is now more likely to fail than was originally the case. That is, $r = P$($\#$2 fails$|\#1$ fails) $> P$($\#$2 fails) $= q$. If at least one pump fails by the end of the pump design life in 7$\%$ of all systems and both pumps fail during that period in only 1$\%$, what is the probability that pump $\#$1 will fail during the pump design life?
